Tessel - Microsoft Azure Hands on Labs
======================================

A set of hands on labs that will help you get up to speed with using Microsoft Azure together with your Tessel micro controller.

[These labs](labs) build up on the information youâ€™ll find on the official sites for:

* Microsoft Azure http://azure.com and
* Tessel https://tessel.io

and are here to accomodate you in acceleration of using these two great technologies/services together. Please make sure you visit the official sites for up to date information and more hands-on labs.

#### [Lab 1 - Setup](labs/_setup)
In this lab you find the steps to help you setup your computer, your Tessel and your Microsoft Azure account. After completing the lab you have a working environment ready for the other labs.

#### [Lab 2 - Azure Websites](labs/websites)
You'll create a custom RESTful Web Service using Node.js and host it in Azure WebSites. Afterwards you will connect to and consume that service from your Tessel microcontroller, resulting in your controller blinking the leds a random number of times.

#### [Lab 3 - Azure Mobile Services](labs/mobile-services)
You'll create a custom RESTful Node.js Mobile Service in Azure using Azure CLI. Afterwards you will connect to and consume that service from your Tessel microcontroller, resulting in your controller blinking the leds a random number of times.
